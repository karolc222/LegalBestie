LegalBestie – UK Legal Knowledge App (MSc Software Engineering Project)

LegalBestie is an iOS application built with SwiftUI, SwiftData, and OpenAI APIs that helps users understand practical legal rights in everyday scenarios (e.g., police encounters, renting issues, immigration contexts).
The app presents interactive legal scenarios, step-by-step decision trees, and verified legal sources to make legal information clear, accessible, and engaging.

    •    Scenario list loads automatically from embedded JSON files
    •    Clean UI with scenario title, description, and last update date

3. In-App Scenario Player
    •    Fully interactive
    •    Displays questions, choices, outcomes, and summaries
    •    Lightweight: no backend needed
    •    Decodes JSON at runtime using a custom UK date format

4. Modular Architecture
